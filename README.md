# RPGToolkit4 or (5)

## Description

This is an attempt to recreate the classic RPGToolkit 3.2.1b, initially written by CBM. It is a tool for creating and editing RPG games. It is a WIP and still under development. It is not finished and is not ready for use.

Note: I like to call it RPGToolkit5 since it will be a complete overhaul of the tech stack used to create it.
